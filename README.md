# Conductor

Control music like a conductor.

## Usage

`yarn && yarn start`

## Future work

- Connect this app to a music generation model to enable a deeper level of control. For example, gestures could be
  mapped not just to model parameters like style and dynamics. Large and bouncy movements could tell the orchestra to
  play in a march style; small and lively movements could signal pizzicato.

- Train a model to replicate movement data captured in this application. An AI conductor trained in such a way could
  conduct a human orchestral ensemble to create a unique AI-led machine-human collaborative performance.

- Use gestures from drummers or dancers, rather than conductors.
